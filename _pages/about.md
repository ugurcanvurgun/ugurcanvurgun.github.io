I hold a Ph.D. from the <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>, where I worked with <a href="https://www.langcoglab.com/current-lab-members">Dr. Anna Papafragou</a> on creating behavioral and computational models to explore the interaction between language and human cognitive systems. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher with <a href="https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/danielle-mowery-phd-famia">Dr. Danielle Mowery</a> at the Institute for Biomedical Informatics, University of Pennsylvania. My research uses AI to decode health records, aiming to transform patient care and uncover the hidden factors shaping health outcomes. I am also a Master's student in the Biomedical Informatics program of <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/">Perelman School of Medicine</a>.

<p>In the<a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/trueswell-lab/"> Language Learning Lab</a>, I work with <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/trueswell-lab/labmembers/trueswell/"> Dr. John Trueswell</a> on how symmetry is represented in language and cognition using novel paradigms with eye-tracking.

Before that, I had a B.A. degree in Business Administration from <a href="https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/">Koç University</a>. Following my undergraduate degree, I spent some time in the industry and managed large sales teams at <a href="https://www.unilever.com/">Unilever</a>. During this experience, I had the chance to get to know so many wonderful people all over Turkey, speaking many different languages and dialects. I am grateful to all of them, as they helped me find out that language science is my passion.<br>
