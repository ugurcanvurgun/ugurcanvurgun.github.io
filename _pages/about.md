I am a Ph.D. candidate working with <a href="https://www.langcoglab.com/current-lab-members">Dr. Anna Papafragou</a> at the <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>. I am interested in creating behavioral and computational models that could reveal the interaction between language and human cognitive systems.

Before that, I had a B.A. degree in Business Administration from <a href="https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/">Koç University</a>. Following my undergraduate degree, I spent some time in the industry and managed large sales teams at <a href="https://www.unilever.com/">Unilever</a>. During this experience, I had the chance to get to know so many wonderful people all over Turkey, speaking many different languages and dialects. I am grateful to all of them, as they helped me find out that language science is my passion.<br>
