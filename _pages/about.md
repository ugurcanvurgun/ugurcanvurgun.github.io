I have a Ph.D. from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/), where I worked with [Dr. Anna Papafragou](https://www.langcoglab.com/current-lab-members) on creating behavioral and computational models to explore the interaction between language and human cognitive systems. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher with [Dr. Danielle Mowery](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/danielle-mowery-phd-famia) at the Institute for Biomedical Informatics, University of Pennsylvania. My research uses AI to decode health records, aiming to transform patient care and uncover the hidden factors shaping health outcomes. I am also a Master's student in the Biomedical Informatics program of [Perelman School of Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu/).

In the [Language Learning Lab](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/trueswell-lab/), I work with [Dr. John Trueswell](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/trueswell-lab/labmembers/trueswell/) on how symmetry is represented in language and cognition using novel paradigms with eye-tracking.

I am affiliated with [the Institute for Biomedical Informatics](https://ibi.med.upenn.edu/) at [Penn Medicine](https://www.pennmedicine.org/), [the Center for Autism Research](https://www.research.chop.edu/car/) at [CHOP](https://www.research.chop.edu/) (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia), and [the Mack Institute](https://mackinstitute.wharton.upenn.edu/) at [the Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/).

My M.A. (Master of Arts) degree in Linguistics is from [Boğaziçi University](https://linguistics.bogazici.edu.tr/), where I studied with [Dr. Mine Nakipoğlu](https://linguistics.bogazici.edu.tr/mine-nakipoglu/) and [Dr. Sumru Özsoy](https://linguistics.bogazici.edu.tr/sumru-ozsoy/) on the syntactic structure of focus particles in Turkish.

Before that, I had a B.A. degree in Business Administration from [Koç University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/). Following my undergraduate degree, I spent some time in the industry and managed large sales teams at [Unilever](https://www.unilever.com/). During this experience, I had the chance to get to know so many wonderful people all over Turkey, speaking many different languages and dialects. I am grateful to all of them, as they helped me find out that language science is my passion.
