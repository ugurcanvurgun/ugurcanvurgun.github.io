I presented a poster at the 9th MACSIM Conference on Saturday, April 15th, 2023. This year's event marked the return of the Mid-Atlantic Colloquium of Studies in Meaning (MACSIM) to its birthplace at the University of Pennsylvania! 

My poster, titled "Lexical Aspect Maps onto Event Apprehension," delved into the intricacies of how our cognitive processes apprehend and process events through language.
