I presented a poster at the 9th MACSIM Conference on Saturday, April 15th, 2023. This year's event marked the return of [the Mid-Atlantic Colloquium of Studies in Meaning (MACSIM)](https://www.macsim.us/) to its birthplace at the University of Pennsylvania! 

My poster, titled "Lexical Aspect Maps onto Event Apprehension," explores how our cognitive processes apprehend and process events through language.
