Delighted to share that I've received the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) Travel Award for [the Meeting on Language in Autism (MoLA)](https://molautism.org/) 2024. This award will support my participation in the upcoming conference, enhancing my contributions to autism research. Grateful for this recognition and opportunity!
