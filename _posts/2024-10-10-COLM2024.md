I had the privilege of being one of the volunteers at the **Conference on Language Modeling (COLM) 2024**, held at the University of Pennsylvania from October 7-9, 2024. This conference brought together leading experts in the field of language modeling, and I was excited to contribute to the event in several capacities.

As part of the conference, I also set up a community group on the Whova event app for individuals interested in using large language models (LLMs) in healthcare. The response to the group was overwhelming, and I had the opportunity to organize a meetup with participants from **NVIDIA, Cerebras, Google, Amazon, CalTech, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), University of Maryland, CMU**, and many other institutions. It was an incredible opportunity to network, share insights, and discuss how LLMs can revolutionize healthcare.

Here are some highlights from the event:

The discussions we had at the meetup were incredibly enriching. We explored how LLMs can be applied in medical diagnosis, patient care, and administrative tasks, and shared ideas about building explainable, robust AI solutions tailored to the healthcare industry.
