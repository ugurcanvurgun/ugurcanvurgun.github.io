I did it! On May 16 I put on the funny hat, crossed the stage in Irvine Auditorium, and officially became **Dr. Vurgun**.  

The ceremony was quick, but the joy was huge—sharing hugs, laughs, and a wave of relief with friends and mentors who helped me get here. Thanks to everyone who cheered, texted, or tuned in online. Couldn’t have done it without you. ❤️

Time to celebrate—and maybe sleep for a week.
