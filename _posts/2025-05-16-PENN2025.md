I did it! On May 16 I put on the funny hat, crossed the stage in Irvine Auditorium, and officially became **Dr. Vurgun**.

The ceremony was quick, but the joy was huge—sharing hugs, laughs, and a wave of relief with friends and mentors who helped me get here. The cool speaker from Philosophy, you made my day. It was an amazing (and quite funny) talk!

Thanks to everyone who cheered, texted, or tuned in online. Couldn’t have done it without you. ❤️

Thank you for the pictures, Daoxin!

Time to celebrate.
