**Publication:** *American Journal of Gastroenterology*. 2025; Abstract P2739.

**Research Focus:** This study demonstrates the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) combined with minimal diagnostic coding for identifying eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) cases in electronic health records. 

**Key Innovation:** The method leverages natural language processing to extract meaningful clinical information from EHR text, reducing the need for extensive manual chart review while maintaining high detection accuracy.

**Impact:** This work has implications for:
- Automated case identification in retrospective studies
- Population health surveillance for rare diseases
- Reducing manual chart review burden in clinical research
- Scalable EHR-based phenotyping strategies
